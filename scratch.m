%{

* pre process data some more ( balance dataset, split, etc.)
* pre process oxy data for testing



 Expected goal/no goal per shot:

* look at matlab NN- decide parameters, etc.\

* train models on euro data
* compare and optimize models
* use development sets to finalize
* use test sets to get overall model accuracy

* compare results from euro set to oxy set 
* judge oxy

-----
compare balanced output to predicting 0 goals
